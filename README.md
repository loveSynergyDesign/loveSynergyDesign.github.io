Yoooo this is a page for the Design Acadeemy club in SUTD

Mostly done to promote the club and as a experience to learn more JS and playing with transitions and animations.

The code is god awful and not organised at all lol, but it was mostly because I did not know where it was going when I started the project and was just playing around.

Regardless I hope that you enjoy viewing the story and the site.
